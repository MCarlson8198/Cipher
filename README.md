# Cipher
rot13 cipher / decoder
This decoder is a basic cipher for the rot13 coding system:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13

It takes any text and outputs the rot13 encoded version.
It also takes any rot13 encoding, and outputs the decrypted version.

All coding was done in Javascript, as part of an answer to the front end developer course on FreeCodeCamp.com. I converted the solution I came up with into an independent work.
